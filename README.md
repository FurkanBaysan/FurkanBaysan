### Get to know me!ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Bahcesehir University, Department of Computer Engineering, started programming with C and C++, improved myself in C# and especially Java programming languages, and wrote many programs. I have the ability to use and apply the object-oriented paradigm at a good level in all languages that support it. I am particularly interested in back-end development within the framework of computer science. Combining my passion for learning and teaching with my profession, I produce content about software on different social media platforms, especially YouTube. My aim is to contribute to humanity by maintaining and sharing learning.
